# **ML Guide**
I aim with this document to centralize all sort of references available to learn about machine learning in any language.

The goal is to have a centralized hub for reference for YouTube channels, books, articles, etc.

Some of the content, specially related to social media, is focused in the brazilian data science environment but fell free to [reach me](https://gguillaux.github.io/ggx/) out to add references for your location or share any other link or information.
